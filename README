Things that I added: PostgreSQL database. I made 3 tables: Users, Orders, Products
AOP Advice @Before

Things that I have to add: @Around, @After

Things that I changed: Now OrderRepo and ProductRepo takes a list of items and adds them. 

Things that I need to fix: if the user already exists in the database don't add them (same for order and product)
Add findByID and findAll to my repositories now with the database
Write business methods to my ProductService class
